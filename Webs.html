            <h1>Why do you need us?</h1>
            <p class="p1">In today's digital world, it is crucial to stay connected with your customers and prospects to
                leverage new markets and expand your business. Statistics show that approximately 4.57 billion people
                worldwide are active internet users, comprising 59 percent of the global population. Within this online
                community, 53 percent perform research before connecting with a brand to ensure they are making the
                right decision<br>.A study from Episerver also found that 92 percent of consumers visit a brands website
                with multiple intentions other than buyingThese include product/service research, comparison shopping
                and business review. This data proves consumers do not purchase on impulse.
                Given the vast global marketplace, it is only reasonable for online shoppers to assess and compare
                brands to find the best possible offerings, prices and features <br>.

                Without a web presence, you automatically lose the opportunity to get in touch with your target audience
                and popularize your brand. Build consumer trust and gain market referrals with an interactive, custom
                web page design.
